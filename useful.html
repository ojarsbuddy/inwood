      <h4>Convention Cards</h4>
      <p>These are a great place to record what systems, treatments and conventions both you and your partner agree to use. It is useful for both of you to work out bridge hands at the table from the same foundation!</p>
      <p>A useful practice is to review the convention card you and your partner agree to use some time before each game to surface questions or understandings that might need a little work or a boost in confidence.</p>

      <h4>ACBL Numbers and Special Local Numbers</h4>
      <p>Enter your number at the Bridgemate terminal. Every player has a number in our data base. This makes you known at each table each round. It also helps the director with club paperwork.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your ACBL number even if you no longer belong to the ACBL.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, enter your Gleneagles account number followed by one more digit, which is 1 for ladies and 0 for gentlemen. This is your special local number!</li>
        <li>Note that if our data base contains an ACBL number, the entry of a Gleneagles account number will register as an error and your name will remain blank.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Web Movements</h4>
      <p>John “Spider” Harris an ACBL tournament director invented web movements in the 1970s to reduce the number of extra deals in play. For example, with 10 tables running 8 rounds at 3 boards per round we have boards 1-30 in play, where pairs play 24 of those. With a web movement, we have two sets of boards 1-24, which means all pairs play the same boards. In the first case comparisons of pairs must necessarily involve different boards played by each pair. In the second case, all pairs compare the same set of boards.</p>
      <p>Clearly there is less bias if comparisons are more alike across all pairs. More clubs use web movements now because more clubs have dealing machines, which make it easier to prepare boards for web movements.</p>
      <p>Smart folks at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mitdlbc/www/contrib.html#Manager">MIT Draper Lab</a> have figured out web movements beyond those the ACBL supplies with ACBLscore.</p>
